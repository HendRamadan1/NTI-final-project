# NTI Final Project: Water Potability Model

## Description

This project predicts water potability using a machine learning model trained on water quality data. It offers an end-to-end workflow: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The repository is designed for maintainability and extensibility, targeting developers who want a clean example of applied ML in Python.

## Techniques Used

- Data preprocessing and cleaning with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
- Feature selection using correlation analysis and importance metrics.
- Binary classification with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) models.
- Model evaluation using [confusion matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html), accuracy, and ROC AUC.
- Data visualization with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for exploratory analysis.
- Interactive data exploration in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
- Uses Python [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for dependency management.
